The key-value API has the same surface similar to the JavaScript [Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) API, except it adds `putItem(object object)` and `match(object JOQULARpattern)`, the methods are asynchronous, the methods take some additional optional arguments, `length` and `key()` are not available.
