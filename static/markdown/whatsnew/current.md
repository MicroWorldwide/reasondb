2019-01-01 To start off the new year, the AnyWhichWay database, which started as a separate project, has been merged with ReasonDB. Although this has resulted in the loss of functionality in some areas (e.g. selective indexing, and changes to the JOQULAR API, automated replicant synchronization), it has also added substiantial functionality including more [predicates for JOQULAR](/#/reasondb/tutorials/joqular), [SQL like](/#/reasondb/tutorials/sqllike) multi-class joins, direct API support for [key/value](/#/reasondb/tutorials/keyvalue) and [graph](/#/reasondb/tutorials/graph) queries, enhanced automatic versioning and data [conflict resolution](/#/reasondb/tutorials/conflictresolution), and [cursors](/#/reasondb/tutorials/cursors) with all the power of arrays. And, it has dramatically simplfied the process of adding storage drivers for almost any key/value store.
