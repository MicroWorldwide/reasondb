2019-01-01 To start off the new year, the AnyWhichWay database, which started as a separate project, has been merged with ReasonDB. Although this has resulted in the loss of functionality in some areas (e.g. selective indexing, and changes to the JOQULAR API), it has also added substiantial functionality including more predicates, multi-class joins, direct API support for key/value and graph queries, data conflict resolution, basic security, and cursors with all the power of arrays. And, it has dramatically simplfied the process of adding storage drivers for almost any key/value store.
