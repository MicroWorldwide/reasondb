When first released in October of 2016, `ReasonDB` was the first 100% native JavaScript automatically synchronizing object database with a SQL like syntax and swapable persistence engines for the browser or NodeJS. 

ReasonDB also supports document and graph based storage and querying, full text indexing and search, JSON projections, pattern based and functional queries, asynchronous cursors, streaming analytics, 32 built-in predicates (including soundex and RegExp matching), in-line fat arrow predicates, predicate extensibility, indexable computed values, fully indexed Dates, joins, nested matching, statistical computations or sampling, and automatic data expiration.

ReasonDB does not require that the class of objects stored be a subclass of any other class, nor does it require objects provide a special calling interface. ReasonDB is probably more compatible with existing object models than any other JSON database. All objects inserted to the database can be activated so that they automatically save or more controlled procedural and functional approaches can be used.
