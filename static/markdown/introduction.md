When released in October of 2016, `ReasonDB` was the first 100% native JavaScript automatically synchronizing object database with a SQL like syntax and swapable persistence engines for the browser or NodeJS. It also supported replacement of it underlying storage engine, full text indexing and search, JSON projections, pattern based queries using JOQULAR, streaming analytics, and 20 built-in predicates (including soundex and RegExp matching).

Now, `ReasonDB` v1.x.x-b (currently in beta) also supports document and graph based storage and querying, functional queries, asynchronous cursors, 32 built-in predicates, fully indexed Dates, joins, multi-source conflict resolution, automatic data expiration, object validation and property aliasing, compuation, and defaults using an enhanced version of JOQULAR. All of this can be done on top of almost any key value store including `localStorage` and `Redis`.

ReasonDB does not require that the class of objects stored be a subclass of any other class, nor does it require objects provide a special calling interface. ReasonDB is probably more compatible with existing object models than any other JSON database. All objects inserted to the database can be activated so that they automatically save when changed or more controlled procedural and functional approaches can be used.
